## 💡 Recommended Adjustments

### **Consider These Changes:**

1. **Make Shinpachi a starter** (if Gintama too hard to unlock naturally)
   - Gives variety in starting personality
   - Idol/music coverage from the start

2. **Adjust Ichikawa unlock:**
   - Maybe make him unlock from romance requests too (since he's romance expert)
   - Currently only triggers on horror (niche)

3. **Kanbaru unlock:**
   - Add fanservice/ecchi as trigger (she's expert in these)
   - Currently only triggers on sports/BL (very niche)
