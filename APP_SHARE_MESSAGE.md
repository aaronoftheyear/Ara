# Ara - Anime Recommendation Assistant

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on **Ara** - an anime recommendation assistant, and I'd love to get your feedback! 🎌

**What makes it special:**
• **Talk to anime characters** - You chat with characters from different anime (Yuji from Jujutsu Kaisen, Marin from My Dress-Up Darling, Bakugo, and more!)
• Each character has their own personality and expertise
• They can refer you to other characters if they think someone else would be better at helping
• Personalized recommendations based on your MAL/AniList or manual list
• Characters remember what you've watched and give tailored suggestions

**How it works:**
1. Connect your MyAnimeList/AniList account (or paste your list manually)
2. Start chatting with a character
3. Ask for recommendations - they'll suggest anime based on your taste
4. Characters will naturally hand off to each other if needed (like Yuji passing romance requests to Marin)

Would love to hear what you think! Especially interested in:
- How the character personalities feel
- If the recommendations are good
- Any bugs or issues you find

Thanks! 🙏
